# Solenoid-Winding-Machine
The objective is to build a low cost thin wire solenoid winding machine where the machine does the winding and also shows the number of turns in the LCD display. This was a project of my mech friends where I helped them with the stuff involving arduino.

## Components Used 
1. Arduino Uno.
2. L293D Motor driver.
3. A 5V DC motor.
4. A 16x2 LCD Display.
5. 4 AA battery compartment.
6. An IR sensor.

## The body of the machine

The entire body was designed using CAD and was made by my mech friends.

## The Final Prototype
